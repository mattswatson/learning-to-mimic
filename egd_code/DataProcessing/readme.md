## Requirements
User needs to download the [Eye Gaze dataset](https://physionet.org/content/egd-cxr/1.0.0/) as well as the images from [MIMIC-CXR dataset](https://doi.org/10.13026/C2JT1Q). 

Note: The Eye Gaze dataset should be placed in the [Resources folder](../Resources). 

Once the files are downloaded then the following scripts are functional. **The Data Preperation section is totally optional and they are shared for transparency purposes. We have the pre-processed data hosted on Physionet.** 

## Description
There are four (4) folders containing the scripts used in the data preparation, data post-processing and validation tasks as described in the paper. Everything with the **[OPTIONAL]** tag is already data you have downloaded and needs to be run **only** if you want to dive deeper into the data preperation. Essentially the only script that you **have** to run is [create_heatmap_images_and_or_videos.py](./DataPostProcessing/create_heatmap_images_and_or_videos.py) script. 

### [OPTIONAL][Data Preparation](./DataPreparation) 
This folder contains scripts to reproduce data preparation for the eye gaze experiment.  There are 3 scripts (run in sequence) that were used to query the MIMIC-IV Database (Google Cloud Big Query) and apply the inclusion/exclusion criteria as described in the paper:
1. [Linking_CXRs_to_ED_admissions.ipynb](DataPreparation/Linking_CXRs_to_ED_admissions.ipynb): This Google Cloud Big Query script produces a table linking all MIMIC-CXRs that are associated with an ED admission in MIMIC-IV Database. User is recommended to follow instructions here to run these queries:
2. [Sample_CXR_eye_gaze_dataset.ipynb](DataPreparation/Sample_CXR_eye_gaze_dataset.ipynb): This Google Cloud Big Query script applies the inclusion/exclusion criteria to generate one table per condition: Pneumonia, CHF, and Normal. User is recommended to follow instructions here to run this script: 
3. [preparing_images_master_sheet.py](DataPreparation/image_preparation.py): This script generates the `master_sheet.csv` table as well as the resized images to use in the eye gaze experiment. It uses the condition tables (Pneumonia, CHF, Normal) from step 2 above. As a requirement, MIMIC-CXR images have to be downloaded first. User may skip the Google Cloud Big Query scripts (1 and 2 above) and just run this script using the downloaded files found in `inclusion_exclusion_criteria_outputs` folder in our PhysioNet project. 

### [Data Post Processing](./DataPostProcessing)
- [calibration_image.png](./DataPostProcessing/calibration_image.png): This is the calibration image used in the eye gaze experiment
- [create_heatmap_images_and_or_videos.py](./DataPostProcessing/create_heatmap_images_and_or_videos.py): This script generates the temporal and static heatmaps using the `eye_gaze.csv` and `fixations.csv`. It requires that MIMIC images have been downloaded.
- [OPTIONAL][map_eye_gaze_from_screen_to_image_coordinates.py](./DataPostProcessing/map_eye_gaze_from_screen_to_image_coordinates.py): This script maps eye gaze from screen coordinates (i.e. `FPOGX`,`FPOGY`) to original image coordinates (i.e `X_ORIGINAL`,`Y_ORIGINAL`). **Running this script is optional since both `eye_gaze.csv` and `fixations.csv` contain this information. This is only if you want to replicate the Eye gaze mapping.** 
- [OPTIONAL][speech_to_text.py](./DataPostProcessing/speech_to_text.py): This script was used to call Google's Speech-To-Text API to generate the transcripts from audio

### [OPTIONAL][Transcript Correction Application](./TranscriptCorrectionApplication)
- [app.py](./TranscriptCorrectionApplication/app.py): This script was used to correct the transcripts generated by [speech_to_text.py](./DataPostProcessing/speech_to_text.py)

### [OPTIONAL][Validation](./Validation)
- [validation](./Validation/validation.py): This script can be used to replicate validation analysis found in the Validation section of the paper
