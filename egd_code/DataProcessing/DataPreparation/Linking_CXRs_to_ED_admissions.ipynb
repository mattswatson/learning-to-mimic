        "1. Age range: ? depends on final target population - should do some exploratory analysis of metadata first\n",
        "2. Gender: raw ED population distribution or half-half? Balanced dataset vs original population distribution? Given limited number of images in the pilot dataset, balanced dataset is more likely to capture a wider feature variation within different strata of target population.\n",
        "3. Admission severity: same as for age - may be an useful indicator of CHF severity if we want to grade CHF\n",
        "4. Technically not too hard...and...not too easy cases.\n",
        "5. PA only - AP may introduce more heterogeneity amongst annotators due to poorer quality of images. PA only is a good idea for a pilot after consulting radiologists.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Diagnoses selected for eye gaze dataset after above considerations\n",
        "1. CHF (congestive heart failure) - grading severity, both Arjun and Ali think this will be really interesting to focus on\n",
        "2. Pneumonia - over annotated by existing efforts already\n",
        "3. Normals - must have\n",
        "\n",
        "## Other interesting diseases that were initially considered but got dropped\n",
        "1. Pneumothorax - requires windowing capability (not allowed by eye gaze software) to report accurately\n",
        "2. Nodules - not enough cases in ED population\n",
        "3. Tubes and lines placement (endotracheal tube, central vascular lines, enteric tubes) - very difficult problem technically\n",
